How to compress files into rar?

Due to licensing issues, an Ubuntu installation does not include packages for RAR files natively. 

Open a terminal and install a rar package:

sudo apt install rar

Here is a basic syntax to compress files:

rar [command] [ArchiveName] [file]

For example:

sudo rar a rartest file1.txt file2.txt

Sample output:

To add a password to your archive, just add -p option to the end of your command and you will be prompted to enter a password:

sudo rar a rartest file1.txt file2.txt -p
